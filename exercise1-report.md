21 Sep, We had a half hour online meeting on hangouts and discussed our exercise. This is our first meeting.

Good - we seperate the excercise into 3 parts and arrange them every two teammates. 

My friend, Quanxin and I take the most difficult part because my friend only has one course this semester. I agreed this decision although java is not so familiar to me as I took 207 2 years ago. 

Good - We also decided that teamates finished their jobs earlier will help us to do this part.

For the coding we decided to do the test part before the main. I think this is a good way for coding, but I don't know if we will waste too much time on the test.

My partner Quanxin wrote the psudocode of the algorithm and I translate them into java.
